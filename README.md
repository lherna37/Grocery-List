<h1>Basic Grocery App</h1>
<p>This basic grocery app allows you to add items to your grocery list and adjust the amount of items you have. This list will remember you through local storage.</p>
<p>I made it using fundamental React principles regarding state and components. This project is simply for me to develop my understanding for React's build-in state management. I was having a hard time understanding the difference between React's state and the way Redux manages state, so this app is a way for me to focus on React's state management.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add pricing functionality</li>
    <li>Allow for multiple lists</li>
    <li>Change state from fundamental React state to Redux state management</li>
</ul>


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
